Previously, we saw how smoothing can foil adversarial noise, but you have to apply this in the preprocessing stage, not to mention you have to figure out how much to apply so that it's effective. Randomized Smoothing employs this smoothing principle by constructing a \"smoothed\" classifier from a base classifier. "

    "To train a smoothed classifier, we must first define a base classifier and all its training parameters. To that end, we need to initialize some standard parameters such as the number of epochs (`nb_epochs`), `batch_size`, the gradient descent optimization algorithm (`optimizer`), and the loss function (`loss_object`). Randomized smoothing also needs to know the number of classes (`nb_classes`) and the sample size (`sample_size`), which is how many perturbed instances it should create per example. We next have to change our training and test datasets to be float32 instead of float64. It will also be useful to make a one-hot encoded version of our labels so that it's easier to plug them into training (`y_train_ohe`) and evaluation (`y_test_mdsample_ohe`) functions without having to transform them every time."
